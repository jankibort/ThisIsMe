              There are multiple ways I could describe myself: adventure lover,
              a social creature, nature junkie and even a party animal. Each of
              these builds an image of who I am. While youâ€™re reading this
              section, you see the Matterhorn peak in the background. Back in
              the days of my childhood I dreamt of climbing this mountain and it
              was way beyond my abilities at that time. Climbing Matterhorn
              still remains one of my life goals, but it also has become a
              symbol for my attitude towards life. One might say, that I keep
              chasing adventure in every dimension of life: professional, social
              and personal. I am more worried of being bored than of being
              overthrown by a challenge or difficulty. One of the rules I praise
              is that trying and failing is better than no trying at all because
              it gives more perspectives and opportunities for the future. My
              name is Jan and this is a page about myself.
