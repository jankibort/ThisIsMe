            There are multiple ways I could describe myself: adventure lover, a
            social creature, nature junkie and even a party animal. Each of
            these builds an image of who I am. While youâ€™re reading this
            section, you see the Matterhorn peak in the background. Back in the
            days of my childhood I dreamt of climbing this mountain and it was
            way beyond my abilities at that time. Climbing Matterhorn still
            remains one of my life goals, but it also has become a symbol for my
            attitude towards life. One might say, that I keep chasing adventure
            in every dimension of life: professional, social and personal. I am
            more worried of being bored than of being overthrown by a challenge
            or difficulty. One of the rules I praise is that trying and failing
            is better than no trying at all because it gives more perspectives
            and opportunities for the future. My name is Jan and this is a page
            about myself.
